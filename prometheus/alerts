i installed prometheus through helm 
then i portforward on 9090 on prometheus pod 
create these two grapgh 
using this 
rate (container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container="app",  container!="POD"}[5m]) first one check the cpu usage of the pod through 5 mins 
kube_pod_container_status_running{container="app"} ==1  second check if the container up and running 

for alert manager 

- name: pod-status
    groups:
      - name: pod not running 
        rules:
          - alert: microservice_status_alert
            expr: kube_pod_container_status_running == 0
            for: 2m
            labels:
              severity: critical
 
 - name: pod-status
    groups:
      - name: pod cpu 
        rules:
          - alert: microservice_status_alert
            expr: rate (container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container="app",  container!="POD"}[5m])
            for: 2m
            labels:
              severity: critical

Explained how to debug MySQL and Java apps in optimizing performance?

looking inside the logs can gives us information 
about the start , insert , delete , update and stop 
but inserting all these logs can slow performance so we can keep the critical one in the production systems
also the duration of operation and table structure can help in tuning performance 
also looking for errors during running the of quries can be handful in troubleshooting and fixing the database performance
setting the query cache can help in read performance as cache "its self means to save a copy of something run before"
we also can montior user session opened so if its exceed number of open session we can block the account in doing any operation
